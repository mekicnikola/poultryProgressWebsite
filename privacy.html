    <h1>Privacy Policy for Poultry Progress</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to our Poultry Farm Management App. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our application.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

        <li>Improve the app’s features and user experience.</li>
        <li>Provide weather information based on your location (if location permissions are granted).</li>
        <li>Send notifications related to the app’s features and updates.</li>
        <li>Serve personalized advertisements based on your interests and preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
    <p>
        Our app may request access to your device’s location to provide weather information specific to your farm’s location. This information is not stored or shared with third parties and is only used to display weather updates within the app. You can choose to enable or disable location access through your device’s settings at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AdMob and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        Our app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and use certain information to serve personalized ads, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information, such as device type and operating system.</li>
        <li>Ad interactions, such as ad clicks and views.</li>

        <li>To comply with legal obligations or in response to a legal request.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting us or using the app’s settings. You can also revoke permissions granted to third-party authentication providers, opt out of personalized ads, or disable location access through your device settings.</p>
